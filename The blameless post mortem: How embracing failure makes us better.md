# The blameless post mortem: How embracing failure makes us better



Notes:



Post-mortem:

- Mortality and morbibity
  
  - Talks about what wrong happened
  
  - What were the path taken to fix the issue
  
  - What assumption were wrong and other were right
  
  - Education set instead of a round table looking at you
